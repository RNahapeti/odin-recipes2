Brushing up and testing knowledge - TOP Recipe Project
------------------------------------------------------

Multi-phase project starting with building the bones via HTML, then coming back later to update with CSS.

Should end as a basic website with a homepage and a couple recipe pages.

Phase 1 - HTML building blocks
Will likely be focusing on different tags and elements to create the basic site layout

Phase 2 - CSS additions
Come back in and make the look of the site match my personal aesthetic using style sheets.
