    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>In this recipe we'll go over how to make some delectably delicious peanut cups from scratch! These sweet and salty morsels go best with semi-sweet chocolate, but you are more than welcome to use milk chocolate or dark chocolate to make it more to your taste.</p>

    <p>We'll also go over two different ways of making them - the first being the classic way, pictured above, where the peanut filling is incased completely in chocolate, and the second way will be in a "sandwich" form, where you can see the peanut filling (pictured below).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>2 cups</b> milk, semi-sweet, or dark chocolate chips</li>
        <li><b>2 tbsp</b> shortening</li>
        <li><b>½ cup</b> butter (salted or unsalted)</li>
        <li><b>½ cup</b> creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li><b>1 cup</b> confectioners sugar</li>
        <li><b>⅔ cup</b> finely ground graham crackers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a 2-quart saucepan combine butter and peanut butter over medium heat until melted.</li>
        <li>Once melted, lower heat and stir in confectioners sugar and graham cracker crumbs. Take off heat once mixed in and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Set up cupcake tray with <em>2 cupcake liners</em> in each (this adds stability when spreading chocolate).</li>
        <li>Make tempered chocolate by melting <em>half</em> the chocolate chips and <em>half</em>shortening in microwave, stirring intermittently until smooth.</li>
        <li>Brush about <strong>1 tsp</strong> of tempered chocolate into each cup liner, making sure to coat the sides. Set aside to cool and harden slightly.</li>
        <li>Peanut butter mix should now be a dough like consistency. Use a spoon to scoop small balls of peanut butter dough and flatten into silver dollar sized discs (slightly smaller than your cupcake liner diameter).</li>
        <li>Place the peanut butter discs into each chocolate filled cup.</li>
        <li>Melt second half of the chocolate and shortening, and spoon/spread it into each cup until the peanut butter discs are covered.</li>
        <li>Place trays into refrigerator and allow to cups to harden for about 2 hours - now take them out and enjoy your delicious and decadent peanut butter cups!</li>
    </ol>
